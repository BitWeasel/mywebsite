In keeping up with my previous rant on industry, I'd like to share with you another little gem that happened to me a little while ago.
As you might know, I work as a consultant in the area of digital security and privacy, and I get payed by customers who want some sort of sensation of doing things right.

## We need to do something with this 'privacy' thing.
To get to grips with this particular gem of money wasting, we need to set the stage.
A few years ago a very nice data protection directive was put into law in the EU.
This was around the same time the Internet became a thing, for the year was 1995.
Over the years, each member state was to implement this directive into national law, as was done in The Netherlands in the "Wet Bescherming Persoonsgegevens" in the year 2000.
It was not until January of this year though, with some additions to this law, that companies started worrying.
And they started worrying for one reason only: Things might start to hurt; finally (after two decades!) having subpar data protection could cost companies lots of money. 
This, to the tune of 820k euro's per incident, or 10% of their annual global turnover if 820k is not enough.

To give you a small timeline:

+ 1995 - Data Protection Directive
+ 2000 - Dutch Data Protection Regulation
+ Summer 2015 - New fines announced
+ January first, 2016 - New fines in effect

Companies being a bit slow on he uptake of legislation, most didn't worry in 1995, nor in 2000, in 2015 they still didn't start worrying.
Then 'suddenly', this new law came into effect, and companies started scrambling to comply with legislation that for the most part was drafted in 1995!

One such company is a customer of mine.
They needed to do something with that 'privacy' thing, that 'data leaks legislation' that has everybody on edge.
They wanted a nice checklist or flowchart on how to handle data leaks, and when they should notify the data protection authority of such a data leak.
Well, I'm not a lawyer, although I do know a bit about this particular area of legislation.
So what does any "computer guy" do when looking for answers? 
We go to a search engine, and using the proper keywords and phases of the moon, we get what we want.

Turned out that there already was a company in the Netherlands who had the foresight of generating such a checklist, and it was a 100% match with what I was looking for. 
Print it, and give it to my customer, together with the link where I got it.
It took me about 15 minutes all in to do that.

## Enter industry
If only it took me those 15 minutes.
I was in stead asked to rewrite the pdf, put a nice corporate sprinkle on top and our own house style, and only then send it to the customer.
I was allowed to bill two full days for this, and let me remind you that consultants are not cheap.

In academia, this would be called *plagiarism*, in industry, this is called *business as usual*, and in my mind, this is one of the reasons why so much money is squandered in IT projects. 
Generating iteration after iteration of the same documents, passing off other people's work and one's own, rebranding stuff, reselling, old wine in new bottles.
Another "definitive guide" to data protection, another "standard" on privacy, another "guideline" on dealing with personal data.
People writing the same things, over and over and over, and billing endless hours for this without actually adding any value.
Money down the drain right there.

I've been asked by several companies to present my views on privacy, so they could create yet another privacy document.
Rather than actually doing stuff, millions are spent creating documents and writing policies that are probably never read.
These documents are printed, bound, and placed on desks and in bookcases, without being used. 
I would not be surprised if of all the hardcopy documents that are being printed, less than ten percent is actually read, and even less are read more than once.
Another source of huge costs, both on money, and in trees.

I could bury you in documentation written about how to handle the 'privacy thing', but it all boils down to a few simple ideas:

+ Respect your data subjects
+ Don't use data for anything other than what is was collected for (this includes not using it for testing purposes!)
+ Don't collect what you don't need
+ Have a legal ground for the processing of data
+ If you wouldn't want someone to do this with your data, don't do it with their data.
+ "Data is the new oil", it's valuable, protect it accordingly.
+ In case of doubt, *don't f-ing do it!*
+ Learn from your mistakes, and from the mistakes of others.

It really isn't that hard to take care of personal data and privacy, once you know what to look out for.
All it takes is stop thinking about how to make more money, and start thinking about people.

And that is why companies failed to adopt the data protection legislation.
